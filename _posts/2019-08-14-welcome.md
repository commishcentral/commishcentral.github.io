Oh, hello there! Welcome to CommishCentral where the powers at be congregate. Most of you have most likely wandered the empty googleverse looking for the perfect site to help you be the best commissioner you can be, and just like myself, all you've found is the "Have Fun!" hoopla. Well my friends, you have finally found your destination!

A fantasy football league is just like your favorite watering hole. You go because of the drinks(FFL) but you stay for the atmosphere and comradery fostered by the bartender(commissioner). A commissioner should be the glue that holds the league together throughout the season. This pseudo commish handbook is meant for those who want to bring your FFL league to the next level just for setup and the draft but week in and week out. So come on in, keep calm, and commish on!
